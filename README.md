# VR Dart project
This was the capstone project for CSCI 5619
You can read more about my project here:
[Applications of Training With VR Darts](Applications_Training_VR_Darts.pdf)

In this project I show the application of skill transfer through training
in a custom implemented virtual reality darts game with the Meta Quest 2
conducting a study to see if throwing accuracy can improve. 

The VR Darts game was created in Unity and the 3D meshes of the darts and dartboard
used was from the Darts Kit created by Clockwise. 

For physical testing an Eastpoint Bristle dartboard and cabinet was used which
uses the same WFD standards regarding the size and weight of the dartboard and
darts. 

Using 6 participants and splitting into 2 groups of control and virtual 
I get the following results.

Using an independent samples t-test it was found that there was not enough evidence to reject that
the two samples are significantly different at 0.05 significance level. However further exploration
and consideration may be warranted due to the limited sample size.

For more information take a look at the paper.
